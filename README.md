## How I set many configurations


### Tailwind
-----------------------

I have used this [article](https://jacobneterer.medium.com/angular-and-tailwindcss-2388fb6e0bab)


### Jest
------------------------

I have used this articles:

- [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [Jest integration with the framework from his documentation](https://www.xfive.co/blog/testing-angular-faster-jest/)



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
